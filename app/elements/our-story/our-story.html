        <h1 class="page-title">Our Story</h1>
        <p>
        	Normally a couple’s origin story starts with the day they met, 
        	but it would be almost impossible to pinpoint that day because Timo 
        	and Mel grew up together. Their mothers were both Sunday School 
        	teachers at Emmaus Lutheran Church, so they, of course, were always there. 
        	The O’Donnell’s moved away for a period of years, and then came back to 
        	Emmaus when Timo was 16 and Mel was 15. Once again they were involved 
        	in a lot of youth activities, often being ‘voluntold’ to help their parents. 
        	Mel admits developing a crush first. “Timo was the guy who always 
        	chopped firewood on camping trips. He was the one who carried the 
        	heavy stuff without complaint, and almost never spoke.” Timo’s early 
        	opinion on Mel was more sweet: “I don’t remember her being as outgoing 
        	as she is now, but she was always creative and resourceful, always 
        	including me in stuff she was doing.”
        </p>
        <p>
        	As they matured, Mel and Timo saw each less, and began to develop 
        	goals and aspirations. Timo’s was a simple four-point list: Graduate 
        	college → get a good job → buy a house → find a girl. Mel followed her
        	own nature and free-flowed. She had a couple boyfriends, worked in 
        	retail, and put college off for a few years. In 2009 they went on a 
        	mission trip to Mexico. Mel states that the only reason she signed up 
        	was to get closer to Timo, but just before the trip began she had 
        	started a relationship with someone else (Too many advances obliviously 
        	ignored by Timo had forced Mel to come to the conclusion that he was 
        	gay and therefore unattainable).
        </p>
        <p>
        	Two years later, Mel asked Timo out via text message and they had 
        	their first date on December 21st, 2011. 
        	Timo moved in with her 6 months later.
        </p>
        <p>
        	On August 17th, 2014 Timo picked Mel up from a 2 week vacation 
        	visiting her best friend in Ontario and proposed over a picnic at 
        	Hawrelak (cough, Hermitage) Park. A few months later, they moved into 
        	their first home, and will become husband & wife on June 11th, 2016.

        <h1>About the Bride - His Perspective</h1>
        <p>
        	Melanie has three words that describe her entire lifestyle since the 
        	day I met her: ambition, creativity and love. Prior to 2014, she had 
        	picked up more skills than I could have imagined through self teaching, 
        	school and her siblings. Painting, drawing, shading, colouring, digital 
        	renderings of all kinds, as well as some savvy business and commerce 
        	tricks which she is continuously optimizing over years of art conventions 
        	and commissions. To date, she has acquired several more as her interests 
        	have changed. Completing a Digital Communications diploma at NAIT and 
        	wrangling print shop machines opened up more doors for her future, but 
        	she wouldn’t settle for a boring shift work job and making other people’s 
        	ideas realities. Instead she continued to follow her interests, having 
        	taught herself again from scratch how to knit, sew, and crochet, now 
        	teaches others as a knitting instructor; her ambition never ceases to 
        	motivate me.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Although her ever evolving skill set definitively surpasses mine, 
        	love still is Mel’s strongest character trait in my opinion. Throughout 
        	all of her projects and deadlines, she still makes time to nurture our 
        	relationship. For all of the ups and downs we’ve had prior to and 
        	during our time together, she is always willing to make it a fair and 
        	wonderful experience for us both. I could not have asked for a better 
        	person to spend the rest of my life with and am proud to be there for 
        	Mel, always.

        <p>
        	Timo is an engineer in training working as a QA developer for 
        	Willowglen Systems Inc. Having finished his bachelor’s degree in 
        	nanoscale system design at the University of Alberta in 2013, spends 
        	most of his working and spare hours tinkering with code, hardware and 
        	development processes. His biggest interests otherwise include camping, 
        	weightlifting, sauna, and board games with friends. He also doesn’t 
        	like using words.
